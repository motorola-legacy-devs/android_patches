## Instructions:

```
git clone https://github.com/motorola-legacy-devs/android_patches patches
```
```
./patches/apply.sh $ROM_TYPE
```
make sure to replace $ROM_TYPE with a rom codename folder that is available.

Example:
```
./patches/apply.sh crdroid-10.0
```

or if I need more than one folder:

```
./patches/apply.sh los18.1-rev protonaosp-r
```
